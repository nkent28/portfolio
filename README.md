# [Start Bootstrap - Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/) For [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com)

[Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/) is a resume and CV theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features a fixed sidebar with content sections to build a simple, yet elegant resume.  

This is my port of the theme to Middleman.

Each section has been separated in to individual partials for easy removal, rearranging, etc. 
A yaml data file for each section exists in the `data` folder.
